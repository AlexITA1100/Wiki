<h1>Client</h1>
<p><strong>How do I install BeamMP?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a full guide on how to install BeamMP on Windows, you can find it <a href="https://wiki.beammp.com/en/home/installation-guide">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Does BeamMP works on a cracked version of BeamNG.drive?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>BeamMP does not work with cracked versions of BeamNG.drive nor that it does on outdated versions. If you want to use BeamMP please consider buying the game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Does BeamMP work on Linux?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>BeamMP client is not officially supported on Linux. However, you might be able to get it working by running the launcher in the same proton prefix as the game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is the launcher flagged by my antivirus or by Windows Defender?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>In order to prevent Windows Defender from flagging a specific .exe, we need to buy a license which is very expensive, therefor, BeamMP might get flagged by Windows Defender.</li>
  <li>Some antivirus may flag BeamMP as a virus because it does some interactions with network and other stuff. There are <strong>no viruses</strong> in any of the code. The code for the launcher, server, and Lua client can be seen on our <a href="https://github.com/BeamMP">Github</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I have poor performance, what should I do?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We are working hard to make performance as good as possible. Sadly, there isn't a lot you can do about it, if you have already lowered your graphic settings and your performance is still poor, consider playing on a server with less players. The game is mainly CPU bound when you play with lots of people, so older CPUs (even quadcores) will suffer with more than a handful of people.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Server</strong></h1>
<p><strong>How can I setup my own server?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>All the information to set up your own server can be found on <a href="https://wiki.beammp.com/en/home/Server_Mod">this page</a> of our wiki.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is the server working on Linux?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We provide binaries for many Linux distributions <a href="https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server/releases/latest">here</a>. If there are no binaries for your distribution, you can build it yourself by downloading the source on our <a href="https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server">GitHub</a>, a tutorial can be found <a href="https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server#build-instructions">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the minimum system requirements to run a BeamMP server?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>RAM: 50+ MiB usable (not counting OS overhead)</li>
  <li>CPU: >1GHz, preferably multicore</li>
  <li>OS: Windows, Linux (theoretically any POSIX)</li>
  <li>GPU: None</li>
  <li>HDD: 10 MiB + Mods/Plugins</li>
  <li>Bandwidth: 5-10 Mb/s upload</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Players outside my network can not join my self-hosted server</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If other players, trying to connect to your server, receive an error code 10060, 10061 or 10038 in their BeamMP launcher, then you should check the following steps:
    <ul>
	  <li>Forward port 30814 (or whichever port you set in your ServerConfig.toml), both TCP and UDP protocols.</li>
	  <li>Allow BeamMP through the Windows Firewall, allow both incoming and outgoing connections. Turning off the firewall will usually NOT work.</li>
	  <li>Make sure you're not using a VPN (this can cause issues).</li>
	  <li>Make sure the server is actually running, without any errors or warnings.</li>
	</ul>
  </li>
  <li>You can check if you have successfully portforwarded using the site 'portchecker.co' whilst the server is running.</li>
  <li>Please note, some internet providers do not offer dedicated IPv4 addresses to your connection, so port forwarding may not be possible, despite it being available in the router.</li>
  <li>Port forwarding is not possible if you are using a mobile (4G/5G) internet connection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I can see my self-hosted server in the server-list, but i can not join it myself</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>If the server is running on the same machine as the game, you yourself have to use Direct Connect to join, with the IP 127.0.0.1 and your server's port.</li>
  <li>For you to be able to join your own, self-hosted server trough the server-list, your router needs to support NAT-loopback, but this is a function not many home routers support.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
<p><strong>Where can I find the code?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>All the source code can be found on our <a href="https://github.com/BeamMP">Github</a>.</li>

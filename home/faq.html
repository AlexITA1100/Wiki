<h1>Client</h1>
<p><strong>How do I install BeamMP?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a full guide on how to install BeamMP on Windows, you can find it <a href="https://wiki.beammp.com/en/home/installation-guide">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Does BeamMP works on a cracked version of BeamNG.drive?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>BeamMP does not work with cracked versions of BeamNG.drive nor that it does on outdated versions. If you want to use BeamMP please consider buying the game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Does BeamMP work on Linux?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>BeamMP client is not officially supported on Linux. However, you might be able to get it working by running the launcher in the same proton prefix as the game.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why is the launcher flagged by my antivirus or by Windows Defender?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>In order to prevent Windows Defender from flagging a specific .exe, we need to buy a license which is very expensive, therefor, BeamMP might get flagged by Windows Defender.</li>
  <li>Some antivirus may flag BeamMP as a virus because it does some interactions with network and other stuff. There are <strong>no viruses</strong> in any of the code. The code for the launcher, server, and Lua client can be seen on our <a href="https://github.com/BeamMP">Github</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I have poor performance, what should I do?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We are working hard to make performance as good as possible. Sadly, there isn't a lot you can do about it, if you have already lowered your graphic settings and your performance is still poor, consider playing on a server with less players. The game is mainly CPU bound when you play with lots of people, so older CPUs (even quadcores) will suffer with more than a handful of people.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Server</strong></h1>
<p><strong>How can I setup my own server?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>All the information to setup your own server can be found on <a href="https://wiki.beammp.com/en/home/Server_Mod">this page</a> of our wiki.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Is the server working on Linux?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>We provide binaries for many Linux distributions <a href="https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server/releases/latest">here</a>. If there are no binaries for your distribution, you can build it yourself you can do it by downloading the source on our <a href="https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server">GitHub</a>, a tutorial can be found <a href="https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server#build-instructions">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
<p><strong>Where can I find the code?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>All the source code can be found on our <a href="https://github.com/BeamMP">Github</a>.</li>
  <li>Before doing anything keep in mind that the code is under <a href="https://forum.beammp.com/topic/94/terms-of-use-v1-0">terms of use</a></li>
  <li>The server, launcher and Lua client code also have licenses:
